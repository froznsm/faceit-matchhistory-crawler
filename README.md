# Faceit Matchhistory Crawler

Small program to analyse the matchhistory of a csgo profile on faceit. This project is for fun and not maintained and was primarily done to learn the usage of selenium.

### Requirements
The geckodriver executable must be in the program path (or change the driver to whatever you want).

### Usage
Exchange the playername [in matches.py](https://github.com/froznsm/faceit-matchhistory-crawler/blob/master/matches.py#L99).
